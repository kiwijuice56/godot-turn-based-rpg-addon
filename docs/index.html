	godot-turn-based-rpg-addon is a Godot addon that implements custom nodes that can handle the structure and functionality of a turn-based game. Features include:

	</p>
<ul>
<li> Node representations of RPG components such as fighters and actions that can be easily expanded for any type of turn-based RPG </li>
<li> Save game functionality that automatically handles saving and loading data </li>
<li>Control nodes with built-in functionality for turn-based combat </li>
</ul>
<p>

This addon is currently in early development, so many features are missing or not fully tested. If you are interested in creating an RPG in Godot and feel that this addon is missing something you desire, feel free to open an issue or contact me!
